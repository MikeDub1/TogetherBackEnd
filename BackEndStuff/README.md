# TinderCloneWithML
This is out project for Sparkdev Spring 2021!

## Instructions for working
Everytime we get to work, let's pull from the main branch to get the latest version of the project on each of our branches. Every Task will have it's own branch which shall be named *TaskNumber_AuthorName*. When you are done workoing on a task, and have tested it to see if it works, make a new branch from the branch where you were working from and name it *TaskNumber_AuthorNameDone*.
